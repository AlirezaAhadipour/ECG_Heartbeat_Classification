# ECG Heartbeat Classification with Deep Learning

This project applies **deep learning models (1D-CNN + LSTM)** to classify **ECG Heartbeat Signals** into different categories. It also explores **transfer learning** to fine-tune a multi-class for binary classification on a holdout dataset.

---

## **Project Overview**
- **Dataset**: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset (via Kaggle)
- **Task**: Multi-class classification (5 heartbeat types)
- **Model**: CNN + LSTM architecture
- **Fine-Tuning**: Transfer learning to adapt to binary classification
- **Tools Used**: Google Colab, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

---

## **How to Run This Project (Google Colab)**
### **1 Open the Notebook in Google Colab**
Open the `ECG_Classification.ipynb` file in the **notebooks** flder and then open the full **Colab Notebook**, which contains everything from data preprocessing to training and evaluation

---

### **2 Dataset Preparation (Kaggle)**
#### Load Data from Kaggle**
- The dataset can be downloaded directly from Kaggle and extracted inside the Colab environment
- You will be prompted to upload your `kaggle.json` to directly download the dataset from Kaggke
